            <p> Hello! Welcome! If you have reached this page in error, it's ok, the world wide web is vast and takes
                you
                to funny and odd places like this one. Do not fret. I have made a portal to another far more
                intelligent
                and stunning world; you might have heard of it, just click on the link to be redirected to
                <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google.</a> I guess here is the part I start to talk myself
                up.
            </p>

            <p> My name is Luis Quintero, I was born and raised in chicago. I am currently in the Northwestern Coding
                Bootcamp
                FullStack Web Developer program. This site will give you a glimpse of my programming potential and let
                you
                (My potential employer) browse through various projects I have completed. In my free time I love to
                produce
                music, dj and practice my instruments. I also try to go on hikes and or nature walks whenever possible.
            </p>
