            <p id="p_section1"> Hello, I am glad you made it to my page. My name is Luis Quintero. I am currently enrolled
                in NorthWestern Universities (Trilogy) Coding Bootcamp. I hope that I can positively display the awesome projects  
                and skills which I have garnered thus far and hope you will consider my work as a glimpse of my creative programming potential.
                I first decided to become a computer programmer when looking for a career change. The thought of discovering and attaining a new skill
                in a field which was rapidly growing and potentially acquiring a new position withing this field, is what drew me in. I have had some previous
                experience working with computers as a CAD Drafter but yearned for a more creative outlet. It seems That I have found it with programming.
                It is not an easy task to handle but I am up for the challenge and am excited to see where this will take me in my career and look foward to
                all the great things to come. Aside from being a diligent worker, I enjoy making music. I love to play guitar and DJ. I also like nature and try to enjoy the outdoors
                as much as possible. Feel free to take a look through my projects and HIRE ME!!! </p>
